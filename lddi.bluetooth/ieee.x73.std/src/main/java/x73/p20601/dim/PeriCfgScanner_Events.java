 * All of the event report styles listed in Table 18 are buffered equivalents to their Buffered counterparts in
6.3.9.4.5. One difference is that the scanner buffers data over the reporting interval and sends a single
message at the end of the interval. A second difference is that the same objects and attributes are included
in each report regardless of whether their values have changed.
