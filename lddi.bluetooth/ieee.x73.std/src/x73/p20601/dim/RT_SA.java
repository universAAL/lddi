	 * Scale-and-Range-Specification:
		The Scale-and-Range-Specification attribute defines the coefficients for an algorithm to map the scaled
		values into their absolute values. The manager shall apply the following algorithm:
		Y = M � X + B
		where
		Y = the converted absolute value
		M = (upper-absolute-value � lower-absolute-value) / (upper-scaled-value � lower-scaled-value)
		B = upper-absolute-value � (M � upper-scaled-value)
		X = the scaled value
		An example of this algorithm in use can be found in Annex B.
